        <h2>üìú About Me </h2>
        
        <p>
          As a graduate of California State University, Northridge (CSUN), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my coding skills and cultivated a collaborative mindset, recognizing the importance of teamwork in achieving successful outcomes in software engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at Glendale Community College (GCC), I had the privilege of serving as a cabinet member in the Scholars Program, a position that required both leadership and technical prowess. As the appointed IT & Workflow Manager, I was responsible for managing the program's website, digital archives, and developing tools for attendance tracking. This multifaceted role allowed me to demonstrate my ability to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and foster a culture of accountability within the program.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my professional career, I have continued to apply this same innovative mindset and dedication to excellence. As a Computer Scientist at Naval Air Warfare Center: Weapons Division, I have leveraged my expertise in radar signal processing and containerized technology solutions to drive innovation and support mission-critical operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, my experience at GCC has equipped me with strong project management skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. I have developed instructional design initiatives and implemented optimization systems, demonstrating my commitment to continuous improvement and delivering tangible results.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Website Developer at CV Fire Protection, I have delivered custom solutions tailored to client needs, showcasing my proficiency in frontend development and dedication to delivering exceptional user experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my personal projects, such as the Frequent-C music streaming app and the Covid-19 Risk Factor Determination machine learning project, I have demonstrated my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions using cutting-edge technologies.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Trained computer to identify patterns in Covid- 19 cases by county. Out of 5,000 counties the AI categorized
              potential risk factors that allowed us to determine that case density and positive test ratio were the two leading
              factors in Covid-19 contraction in counties. The AI retained a 98% success rate in predicting the degree of risk for
              specific counties on a scale of 1-5
