        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
          As a student of California State University, Northridge (CSUN) I have strong aspirations
          to develop coding skills and use my social skills as a vantage point when approaching academic
          group work and major projects. During my time at CSUN I have constructed my identity as a
          coder who is both efficient and collaborative. I believe these two key characteristics that I
          embody are vital to the success of a software engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at Glendale Community College (GCC) I was a cabinet member of the
          Scholars Program composed of students and professors. Each cabinet member would be assigned
          a position and I assumed the role of Webmaster. This position required website managing and
          digital archiving skills, but was notorious for its time commitment. My main function in the team
          was to gather volunteering credits from over 300 students and keep track of their progress. The
          previous webmaster would spend 2-3 hours after each volunteering event inputting credits for
          each individual student. Consequently, the job was tedious because the previous Webmaster
          would input every student's volunteer credits by hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inefficiency of this system interested me, and when I took the position my priority
          was to reduce the time and effort it took to conduct this work. Therefore, I created a QR code for
          each individual student that contained their name and ID number. When students would attend
          volunteering events, I would scan their QR codes with my phone and this code transferred their
          student ID to a column in an excel sheet for the according event. The excel sheet contained a
          formula ‚Äú=IF(COUNTIF(Q$3:Q$280,$D9)>=1, 1, "")‚Äù which would take a specific students ID
          and locate it in the list of IDs from that day's event. I designed the formula so that if the ID
          number is there it would put a ‚Äú1‚Äù in the cell for that event and the student earned credit for
          attending. The else condition for the if statement was left blank to avoid redundant zeros in a
          very large excel sheet.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is very easy to assume a position and become a carbon-copy of the previous position
          holder. It takes a truly creative person to reinvent the system for not only the efficiency of my
          own work, but for that of the whole group. At the end of the year I had made this position so
          easy that the lead professor in the program decided to cut the Webmaster position from next
          year's cabinet.

              Trained computer to identify patterns in Covid- 19 cases by county. Out of 5,000 counties the AI categorized
              potential risk factors that allowed us to determine that case density and positive test ratio were the two leading
              factors in Covid-19 contraction in counties. The AI retained a 98% success rate in predicting the degree of risk for
              specific counties on a scale of 1-5
