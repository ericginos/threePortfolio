        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I earned my Associate degree in Math and Physics from Glendale Community College and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from California State University, Northridge.
        </p>

        <p>
          My recent work centers on computer vision and machine learning for radar imagery at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, where I design and deliver production-ready solutions for client deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I build end-to-end software systems that include signal preprocessing, feature extraction, model integration, error analysis, and technical documentation that supports long-term maintainability.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also bring client-facing experience from commercial sales, where I exceeded targets, improved retention, and developed tailored proposals for decision-makers.
