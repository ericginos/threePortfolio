        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
          As a student of California State University, Northridge (CSUN) I have strong aspirations
          to develop coding skills and use my social skills as a vantage point when approaching academic
          group work and major projects. During my time at CSUN I have constructed my identity as a
          coder who is both efficient and collaborative. I believe these two key characteristics that I
          embody are vital to the success of a software engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at Glendale Community College (GCC) I was a cabinet member of the
          Scholars Program composed of students and professors. Each cabinet member would be assigned
          a position and I assumed the role of Webmaster. This position required website managing and
          digital archiving skills, but was notorious for its time commitment. My main function in the team
          was to gather volunteering credits from over 300 students and keep track of their progress. The
          previous webmaster would spend 2-3 hours after each volunteering event inputting credits for
          each individual student. Consequently, the job was tedious because the previous Webmaster
          would input every student's volunteer credits by hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inefficiency of this system interested me, and when I took the position my priority
          was to reduce the time and effort it took to conduct this work. Therefore, I created a QR code for
          each individual student that contained their name and ID number. When students would attend
          volunteering events, I would scan their QR codes with my phone and this code transferred their
          student ID to a column in an excel sheet for the according event. The excel sheet contained a
          formula ‚Äú=IF(COUNTIF(Q$3:Q$280,$D9)>=1, 1, "")‚Äù which would take a specific students ID
          and locate it in the list of IDs from that day's event. I designed the formula so that if the ID
          number is there it would put a ‚Äú1‚Äù in the cell for that event and the student earned credit for
          attending. The else condition for the if statement was left blank to avoid redundant zeros in a
          very large excel sheet.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is very easy to assume a position and become a carbon-copy of the previous position
          holder. It takes a truly creative person to reinvent the system for not only the efficiency of my
          own work, but for that of the whole group. At the end of the year I had made this position so
          easy that the lead professor in the program decided to cut the Webmaster position from next
          year's cabinet.

                <h4>Covid-19 Risk Factor Descision Tree</h4>
                <p>With Confusion Matrix to test our accuracy</p>
              </header>
              <p>My goal with this project is to give people the necessary information to make an educated decision based on county risk-level. I decided to take data related to COVID-19 within the United States to develop a Decision Tree for the risk factors of US counties. With the 
                many parameters available to me through CovidActNow.org I was able to specifically select which parameters would play into the risk level of a United States County. My parameters were County, Population, Test Positivity Ratio, Case Density, ICU Capacity, ICU Usage, 
                Infection Rate, and Risk Level(0-5).
              </p>
              <header>
                <h5>Plotting the Decision Tree</h5>
              </header>
              <p>In order to isolate these parameters we had to use pandas to manipulate the columns and pick the specific columns that corresponded with the data that we wanted to use. After deleting all the counties that had missing data on my seven parameters, I went from 3222 rows 
                of data to 1585. I then split my data into training and testing data using a 70/30 split with 30% being test data. I was now ready to train my decision tree and opted for the use of gini index. After training our data, I plotted the decision tree to get an idea of the 
                parameters that were used from my dataset. Finally, I tested my model and used a confusion matrix to get an idea of how accurate the tree was classifying my data.</p>

                <h5>Conclusion of Results</h5>
              </header>
              <p>When looking at the decision tree, from the 7 parameters we choose to isolate from the dataset, only 3 were taken into account when deciding the risk factor of a county. case density, test positivity ratio, and infection rate with case density being the root node. 
                As you can see in the figure above, out of the 480 samples, our model was able to correctly predict 474 of the samples at their given risk level.</p>

                1x225 arrays I reshaped it into a 15x15 arrays which made them all fit for images. After creating 15036 images We split them up to their respective Malware and Benign labels and split them up one more time between Train, Validation, and Test. After splitting them 
                we compare the Loss and Accuracy of our Training and Validation data.

                      I trained my data using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the Radial Basis Function (RBF). Then I split my data randomly. 
                      90% of data as training dataset and 10% of data as test dataset. Then I tested out 5 Different gamma values in RBF (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000).
                       For each Gamma value I tested I plotted the graph and its accuracy score. Once all 5 graphs have been created I made a Graph of Accuracy Vs Gamma Values to see what gamma value produces the most accurate grouping.</p>
